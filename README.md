- write control flow using if/else statements.
- use function declarations, expressions, and arrow
functions and describe their differences
- and much more
  
## Introduction

This week you will be working on Javascript fundamentals to practice what you have learned. You will be given prompts to guide you and you should read the prompts carefully.

Assignments are outlined in the `basics.js`, `functions.js`, `arrays.js` and `objects.js` files, please read the instructions carefully for each task and complete it. Note that you may have to use your googling skills to research and look things up if you do not have all the information you need to complete the task.


## Instructions

## Task 1: Set Up The Project With Git

**Follow these steps to set up and work on your project:**

- [ ] Create a forked copy of this project.
- [ ] Add your instructor as collaborator on Github.
- [ ] Clone your OWN version of the repository (Not Gabi's by mistake!).
- [ ] Create a new branch: git checkout -b `<firstName-lastName>`.
- [ ] Implement the project on your newly created `<firstName-lastName>` branch, committing changes regularly.
- [ ] Push commits: git push origin `<firstName-lastName>`.

## Task 2: MVP

Find the `basics.js`, `functions.js`, `arrays.js` and `objects.js` files and complete the tasks as they're written in there. 

As you work on your code you should make use of `console.log` to check your progress and debug.

## Task 3: Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, try any of the following challenges. As always, note that these may require additional research beyond what you learned in this module.

- [ ] See tasks labelled stretch. Please ensure you've completed MVP before you attempt the stretch goals.
